      <div class="box">
      <ul>
        <li><span id="date">1879 Sep-17</span>- PERIYAR E.V. RAMASAMY was born at Erode town in TamilNadu State - India</li>
         <li><span id="date">1895 </span>-He used to hear Tamil Vaishnav religious Gurus talks on
mythologies at his house, enjoying their hospitability. As a boy,he started questioning the contradictions and illusions in the fables of Hindu deities spread by the Aryan Race ie., Brahmins for subjugating Dravidian Race.
<p>- Blossoming of rationalism and atheism slowly in the brain of
this youth - Ramasamy.</p></li>
          <li><span id="date">1898</span>-He married NAGAMMAL, aged 13.
<p> -He reformed his orthodox wife and sowed rationalistic views in
her mind</p></li>
           <li><span id="date">1900</span>-He became the father of a female - child which expired within 5
months and thereafter he had no children</li>
            <li><span id="date">1904</span><strong class="head"> INSULT AT KAASI ENLIGHTENS HIS RATIONALISM</strong>
            <p>-The disgrace inflicted by the Brahmins at KAASI upon him
without the least mercy, made a deep wound in the heart of
Periyar and it inflamed intense hatred towards that Aryan race
and their creation of innumerable Gods</p></li>
             <li><span id="date">1905</span>
              <strong class="head"> SELFLESS SOCIAL SERVICES</strong>
             <p>-One noteworthy instance: Once the dreadful contagious disease
plague attacked Erode. Hundreds of people died and thousands
fled for saving their life. But this noble man did not desert his
native town like other rich merchants. He himself carried the
dead bodies on his back to the cremation ground while even the
close kith and kin did not touch the expired persons for last rites
due to the fear of the contagion of the plague disease.</p></li>
              <li><span id="date">1909</span> Unyielding to stiff protest of orthodox family members, Periyar
arranged the remarriage of his sister’s daughter who became a
child widow at the age of 9.</li>
               <li><span id="date">1920</span><strong class="head"> SACRIFICES FOR FREEDOM MOVEMENT</strong>
               <p>-He ardently participated in the NonCo-operation movement launched against the British rule by
‘Mahatma’ Gandhi.</p>
</li>
                <li><span id="date">1922</span>-When some Congress front-line leaders requested ‘Mahatma’
Gandhi to stop that agitation, he seriously told them that such a
decision of stopping the agitation was not at the hands of himself
but of two women at Erode, implying the wife and the sister of
Periyar!</li>
                 <li><span id="date">1923</span><strong class="head"> PRESIDENT OF TAMIL NADU CONGRESS</strong>
                 <p>-Though he was a Congress leader, Periyar supported that
legislation brought by the Justice Party Government, due to his
sincere concern for securing social justice as well as the rights of
education, employment, economy, etc., to the Dravidian race
oppressed by the Hindu Aryans.</p></li>
                  
                  <li><span id="date">1924</span><strong class="head"> FIGHTER FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE</strong>
                  <p>-The title of honour as ‘Hero of Vaikom’ was
conferred on Periyar for the victory of temple entry of lowcaste people agitations held by our hero.</p></li>
 
 <li><span id="date">1974 Jan 6</span>-After Periyar’s death Mrs. E.V.R. Maniammai headed this Social Revolutionary Movement (Dravidar Kazhagam) and lived upto
1978.
